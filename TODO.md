# TODO.md - Git Synchronization Issue

## üîÑ PHASE 1: RESOLVE GIT PUSH REJECTION

### 1.1. Immediate Actions
- [x] Run `git pull` to fetch remote changes
- [x] Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur
- [x] Run `git push` again after successful pull
- [x] Verify all local changes are preserved

### 1.2. If Merge Conflicts Occur
- [x] Identify conflicting files using `git status`
- [x] Manually resolve conflicts in each file
- [x] Use `git add .` to stage resolved files
- [x] Commit the merge with `git commit -m "Merge remote changes"`
- [x] Push with `git push`

## üîç PHASE 2: INVESTIGATE REMOTE CHANGES

### 2.1. Check Remote Repository Status
- [ ] Run `git fetch` to see remote changes without merging
- [ ] Use `git log --oneline main..origin/main` to see incoming commits
- [ ] Check what files were modified remotely
- [ ] Identify who made the remote changes (if collaborative)

### 2.2. Safe Merge Strategies
- [x] Option 1: `git pull --rebase` (clean history)
- [x] Option 2: `git pull --no-commit` (review before committing)
- [x] Option 3: `git stash` ‚Üí `git pull` ‚Üí `git stash pop` (temporary save)

## üõ°Ô∏è PHASE 3: PREVENT FUTURE ISSUES

### 3.1. Git Workflow Improvements
- [x] Always run `git pull` before starting new work
- [x] Use `git status` frequently to check state
- [x] Commit changes in smaller, logical chunks
- [x] Push changes regularly instead of large batches

### 3.2. Backup Current Work
- [x] Create backup branch: `git branch backup-before-merge`
- [x] Export current changes to zip file as safety measure
- [x] Document current project state before merging

## üöÄ PHASE 4: EXECUTION STEPS

### Step-by-Step Resolution:
1. **SAFETY FIRST**
   - [x] `git branch backup/$(date +%Y%m%d)` - Create backup branch
   - [x] `git status` - Check current state

2. **PULL CHANGES**
   - [x] `git pull origin main` - Fetch and merge remote changes
   - [x] If conflicts: manually resolve each file marked as conflicted

3. **VERIFY MERGE**
   - [x] `git log --oneline -10` - Check merge result
   - [x] Run tests to ensure nothing broken

4. **PUSH SUCCESS**
   - [x] `git push origin main` - Push merged changes
   - [x] Verify on GitHub that push was successful

## üìä POST-RESOLUTION CHECKS

### After Successful Push:
- [x] Verify all project files are intact
- [x] Run framework tests: `python -m pytest tests/ -v`
- [x] Test GUI functionality
- [x] Confirm configuration system works
- [x] Validate logging system operational

### If Problems Persist:
- [ ] Use `git reset --hard origin/main` to match remote (WARNING: loses local changes)
- [ ] Reapply local changes manually from backup
- [ ] Consider using GitHub Desktop for visual conflict resolution
